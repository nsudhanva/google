						<p>
							Pick the topics you think the problem uses, open the hint if you
							are stuck, then show the answer. The card scores your guess
							against LeetCode's tags and shows a short approach. Grade yourself{" "}
							<strong>Visit again</strong>, <strong>Got it</strong> or{" "}
							<strong>Visit less often</strong>; the grade decides when the card
							returns and which list it joins.

					<Section title="Scoring">
						<p>
							Each graded card scores half its topic guess (F1 against the tags,
							less a quarter per hint) and half your grade. Mastery fades with
							time since the last review. <strong>Readiness</strong> weights
							mastery by how often Google asks each problem.

						<p>
							Claude wrote every approach and hint. Claude agents reviewed each
							approach against the problem and the doocs/leetcode reference
							solution. Codex CLI gave an independent second opinion on every
							approach and most hints; a separate Claude reviewer covered the
							hints Codex could not reach. Every disagreement was settled by
							hand. Hints never name the technique you are guessing. They can
							still be wrong; check the LeetCode editorial when something looks
							off.
